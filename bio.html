      <p>I’m Jesse Hooten — a Unity and full-stack developer with experience in C#, game systems, and web technologies. I have passion both for making, and playing, video games. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems.</p>

      <p>I’m highly focused on my technical growth. My favorite thing when programming is to try to find multiple ways to solve the same issue.</p>

      <p>I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and I am happily married to my husband, Trevor. We have three cats: Suki, Sans, and Clawdia. I enjoy making stained glass, and painting.</p>
